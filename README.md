# Gift Hunt Game

Welcome to the Gift Hunt Game repository! This project is a fun and interactive game where players search for hidden gifts within a grid while avoiding a hidden bomb. The goal is to find all the gifts with as few attempts as possible.

## How to Play

- **Getting Started**: When the game loads, you'll be presented with a grid of squares. The grid size depends on the level you choose: 3x3, 4x4, or 6x6.
- **Making a Guess**: Click on any square within the grid to reveal what's hidden inside. Each square may contain either a gift, a miss, or a bomb.
- **Finding the Gifts**: Your task is to find all three gifts hidden within the grid. When you click on a square, if it contains a gift, you'll see "Gift" displayed. Keep clicking squares until you've found all three gifts.
- **Avoiding the Bomb**: Be careful! Among the squares hides a bomb. If you click on the square containing the bomb, you lose the game immediately.
- **Winning the Game**: Once you've successfully found all three gifts without clicking on the bomb, you win the game!
- **Game Levels**: There are three levels of difficulty to choose from, each with a different grid size. You can select the level before starting the game.

## Features

- **Randomized Gift Placement**: The location of the gifts and bomb changes each time the game is loaded, adding replay value.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Simple click-to-reveal mechanics make the game easy to play for all ages.
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose from three different grid sizes to tailor the challenge to your liking.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Receive instant feedback on each guess with clear indicators for gifts, misses, and the bomb.
